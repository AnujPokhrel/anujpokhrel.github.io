Hi! I am a PhD student at George Mason University, [RobotiXX lab](https://people.cs.gmu.edu/~xxiao2/RobotiXX/lab.html) advised by [Dr. Xuesu Xiao](https://cs.gmu.edu/~xiao/). My research focuses on off-road navigation in robotics. I design, build, and deploy robots tailored for challenging off-road environments.

My work integrates principles from physics, control systems, and planning algorithms to develop robust solutions for off-road robotics. By combining these disciplines, I aim to push the boundaries of what robots can achieve in complex and unpredictable terrains.

Beyond research, I am an avid aviation enthusiast with aspirations of earning a private pilotâ€™s license. The challenges and precision of aviation inspire me and complement my passion for innovation and exploration.
